<h1>The Best Movies According to Sheri</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Movies of All Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Spiderman - No Way Home</h3> 
<p>I am a huge spiderman fan and I loved the twist at the end</p>

<h3>Blank Panther: Wakanda Forever</h3>
<p>As you can tell I really like marvel. I loved the technological advancements within the film and the way they explored grief and the importance of the grief not consuming you.</p> 
<h3>Pretty Women</h3>
<p> Who doesnt like a good chick flick that shows us money means nothing when it comes to love.</p>
